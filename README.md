# Project euler

For the problems and the project see [this website](https://projecteuler.net/).
I'm undertaking this project in `typescript`.

My goal is to solve to problems in consecutive order, adapting my solution to the complexity of the issue at hand.
So, I will not be implementing complex algorithms if a more straightforward solution achieves the goal within reasonable time.
